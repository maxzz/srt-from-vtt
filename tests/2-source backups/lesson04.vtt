If you want to create a public package or if different people work on the same project, then you need

00:07.740 --> 00:11.880
to create a package, the Jason file in the root of your project.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.760
If you don't plan to distribute your software and want to work on it just on your local computer, then

00:18.760 --> 00:20.680
you can go on without this file.

00:21.920 --> 00:28.190
Here is sample package, the Jason file, for example, it contains name of the project, my project

00:28.190 --> 00:32.690
and its version 1.0, the format is Jassal.

00:33.020 --> 00:40.010
So what does Jason Jason is JavaScript object annotation and it is format for data exchange.

00:41.540 --> 00:49.700
Jason Object contains key value pairs where Key is embedded into the quote, and it's very easy to convert

00:49.700 --> 00:52.460
Jason to JavaScript object and back.

00:54.770 --> 01:03.050
OK, how can you create a of Jason file, you can create it either manually or with the help of MBM

01:03.050 --> 01:03.980
or Young.

01:05.450 --> 01:13.190
There is a special command, gold and B.M. in it, or you are in it, and this command will guide you

01:13.340 --> 01:20.570
through the list of interactive prompts and you will set name of your project, such Burraston set out

01:20.840 --> 01:21.470
and so on.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.320
OK, let's try this for our project.

01:25.750 --> 01:32.020
Let's go to the terminal and just and in it in our project directory.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.430
So now I'm in Bable internal folder.

01:35.530 --> 01:36.430
So in a minute.

01:37.380 --> 01:45.960
So package, name it, the Bible intro version 1.0 zero and no description, entry point, let's leave

01:45.960 --> 01:48.900
it by default index dodgiest test command.

01:49.020 --> 01:51.610
We will admit it now git repository.

01:51.750 --> 01:59.850
Now it is not hosted ungeared enter no keywords, all just Mogadon and license.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.640
Icee is free license.

02:02.220 --> 02:03.230
Lets enter it.

02:03.240 --> 02:03.930
Is it ok?

02:04.110 --> 02:04.530
Yes.

02:05.500 --> 02:12.070
And now, as you will see, that package that Jason was created in the route of my project.

02:13.450 --> 02:18.550
Let's now open package the Jassam File Visual Studio code, so here it is.

02:19.030 --> 02:23.840
So here is the name of my project and it's one of the 020.

02:24.650 --> 02:30.340
OK, let's not look at the example of package, the design file in one of the public packages.

02:30.970 --> 02:32.410
Let's switch to Google Chrome.

02:32.560 --> 02:37.810
And here let's open package the Jassam for Bable Seelie package.

02:39.490 --> 02:43.360
So here is this file, here is the name of the project.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.070
Here is the current version.

02:45.610 --> 02:55.360
Description of home page license is also free license git repository for this package, keywords.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.410
And below, you'll see a list of dependencies.

02:58.870 --> 02:59.440
No worries.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.030
We'll talk about dependencies soon.

03:02.050 --> 03:06.940
Please note that each project and each dependency has Bertel.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.630
Let's talk about the now suing a second.
