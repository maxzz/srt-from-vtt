00:00.630 --> 00:02.970
Let's talk about bycatch versus.

00:04.050 --> 00:12.270
It's very important concept for each public package must have unique name and version, and each time

00:12.270 --> 00:15.630
when you update package, you must update its version.

00:17.220 --> 00:24.840
And there was special agreement to set versions of the packages and it is called semantic versioning

00:24.990 --> 00:27.060
or shortly somewhere.

00:28.410 --> 00:33.310
If you want to read about this agreement, you can go to some of our dot org.

00:33.660 --> 00:39.300
And here is just a short piece of text where everything is described.

00:40.530 --> 00:42.720
Burzum consists of three parts.

00:43.290 --> 00:46.770
It's my version, Mindoro version and page.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.770
And those numbers are separated by DOT.

00:51.700 --> 01:00.760
So in this example, five is my daughter Barsoum, 21 is my Nerva and 17 is Petch, what those numbers

01:00.760 --> 01:02.200
mean and what is the difference?

01:03.380 --> 01:11.230
If you perform some bug fixes, then you need to change Bedrosian if you introduce some new features

01:11.690 --> 01:18.260
but your package remains compatible with previous versions, then you just update minor version.

01:19.070 --> 01:24.300
If you introduce some non-convertible features or change your project completely.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.220
Then you need to change your version.

01:28.250 --> 01:35.320
If other packages depend on your package and if you update your version, then you don't guarantee that

01:35.510 --> 01:38.410
new updated version will work as before.

01:39.050 --> 01:44.930
If your package depends on external package, then you can specify which version of external package

01:44.930 --> 01:45.500
you need.

01:46.510 --> 01:53.220
If you need exact version, then you need to type it like five 21. 17 exact version.

01:54.200 --> 02:01.850
If version may be greater than specific volume, then you need to add greater than sign before version.

02:03.140 --> 02:09.830
If you accept only compatible changes of Extoll package, then you need to use Syntex like this Garratt

02:10.100 --> 02:20.480
five, the 21. eight, in this case 21, it's Mindoro and a dispatch motion may change, but major version

02:20.480 --> 02:21.650
five is fixed.

02:23.170 --> 02:31.270
If you accept only minor level changes, then you need to use syntax like the five the 21 dot ed, in

02:31.270 --> 02:34.470
this case, only version may change.

02:35.710 --> 02:43.990
There are also Brett Earley's versions of Alpha, Beta and release candidate, they are added after

02:43.990 --> 02:48.760
the version, like in this example, 1.0 to the iPhone.

02:50.030 --> 02:53.990
This Alpha version is older than Alpha, one of our.

02:55.230 --> 02:58.730
This version is older than the better version.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.730
And the way is older than better dot to version.

03:04.760 --> 03:12.650
And this one is older than 11 and better versions are older than ARACY released, can today's.

03:13.690 --> 03:18.640
And finally, you release Burraston without any suffixes.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.050
Let's now look at the package version of the public package.

03:23.550 --> 03:28.830
Let's go back to Bill Graham and he'll look at the package, the Jason file of Bable Selya.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.350
And what is this one?

03:32.280 --> 03:35.170
So it is seven zero zero.

03:35.230 --> 03:39.660
That's better not 51, so seven is my release.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.730
Zero is minor release.

03:42.030 --> 03:43.760
Zero is Page.

03:44.100 --> 03:49.170
And here you see better and it is 50 better version.

03:50.380 --> 03:57.190
So then it will become a candidate and finally, Boston seven zero two zero will be released.

03:58.530 --> 04:06.480
If we will look at the dependencies below, you will see that this Bable Scilly package requires commander

04:06.480 --> 04:06.960
package.

04:08.080 --> 04:17.860
That is compatible with two, that one, so it means that this minor operation may change and this operation

04:17.890 --> 04:18.490
may change.

04:19.490 --> 04:28.220
So say, for example, with Glaube package, we need to stay inside of the silent majority is in effect.

04:28.220 --> 04:31.570
All dependencies have Garratt before.

04:31.620 --> 04:37.130
But no, it means that we install all the compatible updates.

04:38.290 --> 04:43.750
OK, let's move on and next, let's talk about installation of the packages you.
