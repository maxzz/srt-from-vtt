Hello and welcome to the school's Understanded CAPM NOGs package manager.

2
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,220
My name is Mukden and I will be an instructor during the school's.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,070
In this course, we will answer several important questions, first one, how you can initialize your

4
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,450
project using NPM.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,010
What is the package JSON file?

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,720
We will discuss semantic versioning and you will understand what is the difference between major minor

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,370
and software versions.

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,470
And I'll explain you in which cases, which version should be updated.

9
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,560
You will also understand what special characters such as Steel or Garratt mean when they used along

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,160
with package.

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,150
I will also answer a very common question why not modules folder is so large and why it shouldn't be

12
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,940
committed to source control systems.

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,970
We will talk about difference between dependencies and development dependencies, and you will clearly

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,840
understand, in which case you should add baggage as dependency and in which cases as development dependency.

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,000
In order to answer this question, we will talk about difference between browser applications and several

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,210
packages, and you'll get a challenge to create one of the browser applications yourself and you will

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,320
not use any external modules for that.

18
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,730
I will also explain purpose of the package.

19
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,340
This log, the JSON file or in Yoran.

20
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,570
It is young but log.

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:38,100
You'll understand how this files helps you to keep same software packages, viruses on different computers.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,240
But what about and postscripts probably have seen such a long list of scripts in the package.

23
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,940
What is the purpose of each script, how it is used, how it is executed?

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,520
In this growth, we will talk about built in a script such as start, start, start, stop, restart

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,100
and so on.

26
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,850
We will also discuss KOSTERMAN film scripts and you will create several scripts yourself.

27
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,110
We will also discuss how you can combine different scripts in a one script.

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:17,090
We will discuss the purpose of the DOD Benfold, the load modules folder, and I'll explain to you what

29
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,350
is executable script.

30
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,000
Probably earlier you have seen such a line in the executable script.

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,100
And in this course, I'll explain you how it is used on Windows and on Mac.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,400
And this girls, I'll give you several challenges and you'll need to complete each of them yourself,

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,200
but of course, no worries.

34
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,070
We'll talk about solution of each challenge together.

35
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,070
